# Chat-Bot-Python-Opp
A fun and interactive OOP-based chatbot system built in Python.

Features
Four distinct personality bots – HappyBot, SadBot, BoredBot, and SarcasticBot — each with unique tone and style.

Dynamic mood system – bots randomly change mood each time they respond; all recent moods are tracked in a mood_history list (up to latest five).

Bot-to-bot conversation – take any two bots and simulate a back-and-forth dialogue using a predefined message sequence.

Polymorphic design – each bot overrides a respond(message) method to deliver personality- and mood-based replies.

Simple, modular architecture – easy to extend by adding new bots, moods, or response logic.
